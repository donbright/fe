file editor, a very, very simple text editor for linux text mode displays

Current Status:

alpha quality, not usable

Goals:

This program is an extremely simple, minimalistic text editor in the 
spirit of WordStar(TM), University of Washington's PICO, Free Software 
Foundation's Nano, the JOE editor, as well as newer editors like Typewriter, 
DarkCopy, WriteMonkey, etc.

To use: Switch to linux textmode by hitting ctl-alt-f3 or ctl-alt-f4

type python editor.py

To save: there is no saving. every keystroke is instantly saved
to disk in a file named 'delme'.

ctrl-x to quit
