file editor, a simple text editor for linux text mode displays

Current Status:

alpha quality, not usable

Goals:

This program is an extremely simple, minimalistic text editor in the 
spirit of WordStar(TM), University of Washington's PICO, Free Software 
Foundation's Gnu Nano, JOE, as well as newer editors like Typewriter, 
DarkCopy, WriteMonkey, etc.

 Each file can only be 1000 lines long, no more.

 The screen is completely, pure black. No filename, no border, nothing.
 And no blinking cursor.

 There is no 'saving' of files - each character you type is instantly
 saved in the file you are editing. 

The program is completely focused on the Linux Text-Mode Virtual 
Terminal, available on most linux machines by typing ctrl-alt-f3 or 
ctrl-alt-f4. It is not easily portable, and not designed to be run 
inside of a GUI windowing environment. It is intended somewhat to 
replicate the old look and feel of a PC or word processor from the 
1980s.

The code is intentionally kept simple. It is probably easier to fork 
the code and rewrite it yourself than it is to request a feature.

It is not intended for editing of computer programs, just simple text.
